# Title Sync Obsidian plugin

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that updates first-level heading in Markdown when file is renamed

## What this plugin does

Whenever you rename a file, this plugin does the following:

1. If the old filename matches the first-level heading (`#`) in Markdown, it updates the heading to match the new filename.
2. If there’s no first-level heading in Markdown, it adds a heading that matches the new filename.
3. If the first-level heading in Markdown doesn’t match the old filename, it does nothing.

**Note:** This plugin is intended to be used with disabled “Show inline title” option in Obsidian.

## Motivation

I want my Markdown files to be self-contained and have a first-level heading (`# Pizza`), so they work look good in any app, not just in Obsidian.

Also, sometimes I want to use special characters in the title (such as `():`) that aren’t allowed in filenames. This is only possible with a first-level heading, which creates inconsistent notes with default Obsidian settings (when the “Show inline title” option is enabled).

This plugin was inspired by the [Title renamer](https://github.com/stroiman/obsidian-title-sync) plugin.
